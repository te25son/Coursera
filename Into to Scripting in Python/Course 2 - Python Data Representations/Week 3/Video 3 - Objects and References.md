OBJECTS & REFERENCES
--------------------

Think of a reference as a name tag. You can put it on to name an object. You can also take it off and put it 
back on again. Or, if you're feeling especially crazy, you can take your name tag off of one object and put it onto 
another object. Whoa!

Furthermore, you can put multiple name tags onto one object. For example:

In the above example my_list refers to the list object [1, 2, 3]. In other words, we've placed a name tag on our list
to introduce it as "my_list". When we call my_list, we are realling calling list [1, 2, 3].

On the second line we declare my_other_list = my_list. By saying this we are telling Python we want my_other_list to refer
to the object referred to by my_list.
