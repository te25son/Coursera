OBJECTS & REFERENCES
--------------------

Think of a reference as a name tag. You can put it on to name an object. You can also take it off and put it 
back on again. Or, if you're feeling especially crazy, you can take your name tag off of one object and put it onto 
another object. Whoa!

Furthermore, you can put multiple name tags onto one object. For example:
