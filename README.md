# Coursera

A link to my first Coursera course - Intro to Scripting in Python:

### Other useful things (python related)

<b>Podcasts:</b>
- [Talk Python to me](https://talkpython.fm/)

<b>Readings:</b>
- [Python-for-kids](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) 
    - Don't laugh. This was hands down the most helpful introduction to Python I could find. It covers all the basics and more in a simple, straightforward way. Despite being advertised for kids, adults new to Python will no doubt find some challenges in this book.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)
    - This is a HUGE step up from Python-for-kids. This is "Python-not-for-kids". It has everything you need to know on Python and more. I use this all the time as a way to more thoroughly cover the topics I'm learning in class. Plus the excersises at the end of each chapter are challenging and allow you to be creative. 
  
<b>Web Frameworks:</b>
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - I chose this framework to begin learning on because of the saying "pirates use Flask, the navy uses Django" (at least I think it's a saying...), and I'd much rather be a pirate. Flask is easy to get set up and started, and perfect for those just starting out to learn a bit about developing web applications.  
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - I haven't played around with Django much yet, but from what I understand it includes more out-of-the-box features than does Flask, though is more difficult to initially start up.
