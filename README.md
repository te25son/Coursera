### Other useful things (python related)

<b>Podcasts:</b>
- [Talk Python to me](https://talkpython.fm/)

<b>Readings:</b>
- [Python-for-kids](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) 
    - Don't laugh. This was hands down the most helpful introduction to Python I could find. It covers all the basics and more in a simple, straightforward way. Despite being advertised for kids, adults new to Python will no doubt find some challenges in this book.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)
    - This is a HUGE step up from Python-for-kids. This is "Python-not-for-kids". It has everything you need to know on Python and more. I use this all the time as a way to more thoroughly cover the topics I'm learning in class. Plus the excersises at the end of each chapter are challenging and allow you to be creative.
