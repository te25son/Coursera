#### Why Did I Decide To Take This Tutorial?

Why not?
Really, I want to learn more about OOP, and this seems like a very good way to do it.
I would also like to have a pet project for creating a similar game. I used to create fantasty worlds and history when I was a kid, and this seems like an interesting way to bring those old creations to life. 
Also, challenging yourself to learn something new is good for the brain ;)
